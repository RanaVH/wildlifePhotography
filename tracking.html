                    <p ALIgn="justify">Historically, wildlife tracking was something that people had to do by following
                        an animal, watching how it moved, and observing its typical habits. With any luck, it would be
                        possible to catch the animal, tag it, and release it back into the wild. Hopefully, the same
                        animal could be recaptured in the future, which would allow scientists to learn more about its
                        behaviors and habits. Today, scientists have tools like GPS that help with observing and
                        tracking animals to learn more about their behaviors.</p>

                        Animal Tracking is the ability to gather evidence of local wildlife like tracks, scat & other
                        animal sign, and then use these clues to interpret animal behavior and locate wildlife in the
                        environment.

                        There are specific techniques for identifying tracks & sign, determining the speed of travel,
                        behavior & even individual characteristics like size & sex of the animal.

                        For our prehistoric ancestors, tracking was used extensively around the world as a hunting skill
                        to acquire food, as well as to stay informed about possible dangers in the area.
                        A skilled tracker uses their awareness to better predict and locate the best places to hunt
                        animals like deer, moose, rabbits, bears and other types of game essential to survival.

                        For this reason hunting is the most obvious historical application of tracking, however it’s
                        important to realize this skill actually goes far beyond studying animals with obvious food
                        value.

                        <br> <b>An Ecology of Tracking Knowledge…</b><br>

                        At it’s core, animal tracking depends on having a deep understanding of precisely how and why
                        everything in nature is intimately interconnected.

                        To really learn tracking at the deepest level, we need to have a complete understanding of how
                        nature works as a system that includes plants, trees, birds, frogs, insects & energy cycles
                        through time & space.

                        Using this complete ecological knowledge, trackers can get close to animals not just by
                        following trails and direct evidence, but by anticipating animal behavior in it’s complete
                        environmental context.

                        To the untrained eye, this level of tracking skill can appear almost like magic, but it really
                        just comes down to practical sensory training that can be learned & passed down through
                        mentoring.

                        So let’s begin your training in the same place all trackers have begun since the dawn of time…
                        Let’s talk about tracks!

                        Strictly speaking – A track is the impression of an animals foot after it walks in any soft
                        substrate like sand, mud, silt or snow.

                        In the same way your own foot has a heel, an arch, and toes that leave observable tracks and
                        identify as human, all animals have uniquely identifiable tracks that match their species.

                        Being able to identify the different types of tracks is one of the first steps towards becoming
                        a competent tracker.

                        As we study the tracks of different animals, we learn to observe and identify the key
                        characteristics like toes, claws, symmetry, size, and negative space between the soft pads of
                        mammals.

                        So to give you a better sense of how to study animal tracks, here’s a video I created comparing
                        cat tracks & dog tracks in terms of their unique characteristics:
                        The important thing to realize as you watch this video is there are universal principles behind
                        how to observe and categorize all animal tracks.

                        The point is not just to help you see the difference between canines (like foxes, coyotes,
                        wolves) and felines like (bobcats, mountain lions & house cats).

                        The real purpose is that with practice & “dirt time”, the same skills required to identify a dog
                        track can also be applied to weasels, squirrels, deer, rabbits, even frogs, lizards & elephants.

                        Scientists use three different types of radio tracking systems: VHF radio tracking, satellite
                        tracking, and global positioning system tracking. Radio tracking technology makes it possible to
                        know precisely where animals are at any time. It's even possible to determine what an animal is
                        doing. Tracking devices deliver data that scientists use to know daily movements, the area in
                        which an animal ranges, other animals in the same range, and the habitats used by an animal.
                        This information makes it possible for scientists to devise ways to manage animal populations,
                        to know how development might impact animals, and to know if the animal population is sufficient
                        for reproduction of the species.

                        VHF radio tracking has been in use since 1963. Just like a car radio that picks up a signal from
                        a radio station when tuned to that frequency, VHF radio tracking involves the use of a radio
                        transmitter that sends a signal. Scientists will capture an animal, sedate it, gather data about
                        the health of the animal, and place a radio transmitter on it, which transmits a signal to an
                        antenna and receiver. This method of tracking requires that researchers be within a certain
                        range with a radio antenna to pick up the signal from the animal. After picking up the signal,
                        scientists can find the animal from an airplane, from a vehicle, or on foot.

                        Recent improvements to this technology have made it possible to make radio transmitters smaller.
                        Smaller transmitters mean that it's possible to track smaller animals, since the transmitters
                        can easily be attached without hampering their movement. Some transmitters can be swallowed by
                        animals. Sometimes, scientists embed them under animals' skin, too.

                        Satellite tracking is somewhat like VHF radio tracking, but instead of using a standard radio
                        signal for transmitting to a radio receiver, the signal is sent to a satellite. Satellite
                        tracking makes it possible for scientists to pick up signals from greater distances, so the
                        researchers don't need to be close to the animals they are tracking. Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet

                        GPS tracking is the latest type of technology to be used for tracking wildlife. With GPS
                        tracking, scientists place a radio receiver on an animal that picks up satellite signals. The
                        receiver can use this data to calculate where the animal is and how and where it is moving. The
                        information gathered by the receiver is transmitted to another set of satellites, which then
                        send the data to the researchers. Scientists are working to make these tracking devices smaller
                        to enable more animals to be tracked. Some GPS receivers can even be powered by solar energy and
                        are small enough to attach to birds.

                        Scientists are continually working and researching to learn as much as possible about animals,
                        their behaviors, and their habits. Scientists use many different techniques to gather
                        information, including manual observation of animals out in the wild, observation of animals in
                        captivity, laboratory research, and tracking and monitoring with radio tracking technology.
                        These information-gathering techniques help scientists understand more about animals, which
                        helps humans know what animals need to be healthy and thrive in their environments.

                        At it’s core, wildlife tracking is really about asking questions related to nature and finding
                        evidence to answer those questions.

                        In order to make the fastest progress, it’s important to know which questions to ask first,
                        second, third, and so on.

                        Our goal is to reconstruct the complete story of events in much the same way a detective would
                        reconstruct a crime scene.

                        This is an engaging process of asking questions, gathering evidence, creating theories and then
                        testing our assumptions to discern the truth about what happened before we arrived on the scene.

                        The true extent of tracking is absolutely NOT just about knowing there was a bobcat walking
                        through the mud.

                        If you really want to track animals effectively then we need to work towards a deeper
                        understanding by asking questions like:
                        What was it doing here?</li>

                        <br>Was it hunting or just passing through?

                        <br> When did it pass by?

                        <br>Where was it going and why?

                        <br>What if you actually want to see that animal with your own eyes?

                        <br>What if you actually want to see that animal with your own eyes?


                        As you can see, the deeper you go with your reconstruction of events, the more complex and
                        strategic your tracking becomes.

                        All these questions and many more can be confidently answered by studying the more subtle
                        patterns of tracks and how animals interact with their environment.

                        If you’d like to really go deep with track analysis, I highly recommend you check out my other
                        article on how to read what tracks are telling you
